# Practice_Git
Revising GitHub basics

I am trying to practice the use of GitHub in context to Data Alanytics.
The course I am following for this, touches the Git requirements from a very high level aspect.
Further studies and practice through full end to end Analysis projects and using git as a way of asset management,
would be the preferred form of practice and deepening the understanding of this distributed system.
